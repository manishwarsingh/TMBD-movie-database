# TMBD-movie-database https://www.themoviedb.org/

I have fetched the data using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and using the IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the Data like Movie_name, movie_id, provider_name, Buy_provider etc. given by the user in the IMDB site using requests, asyncio, pandas etc.

**How to get the API key?**

Create an account in https://www.themoviedb.org/, click on the API link from the left hand sidebar in your account settings and fill all the details to apply for API key. If you are asked for the website URL, just give "NA" if you don't have one. You will see the API key in your API sidebar once your request is approved.
